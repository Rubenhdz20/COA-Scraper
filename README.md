# üß† COA Scraper ‚Äî Cannabis Certificate of Analysis Data Extraction

  
**Tech Stack:** Next.js 15 ‚Ä¢ React 19 ‚Ä¢ TypeScript 5 ‚Ä¢ Prisma 6 ‚Ä¢ Tailwind 4 ‚Ä¢ Mistral AI OCR  

---

## üåø Project Overview
**COA Scraper** is a Next.js application designed to automate the extraction of key information from cannabis Certificates of Analysis (COAs) in PDF format.  
It leverages **AI-powered OCR** and a **multi-strategy extraction engine** to accurately identify and validate cannabinoid data, terpene profiles, strain names, and batch identifiers across diverse laboratory templates.

The system provides real-time processing feedback, confidence scoring, and export capabilities for structured reporting ‚Äî eliminating the need for manual data entry and reducing processing time dramatically.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
- **AI-Powered OCR** using Mistral AI v1.10 for high-accuracy text recognition.  
- **Multi-Strategy Extraction Engine** with lab-specific algorithms (2River Labs, SC Labs, Steep Hill).  
- **Advanced Text Processing** ‚Äî normalization, pattern recognition, and data validation with confidence scoring.  
- **Real-Time Status Tracking** via asynchronous queues and polling.  
- **Copy-to-Clipboard & CSV Export** for single or multiple documents.  
- **Responsive UI** built with React 19 + Tailwind 4.  
- **Cloud Deployment** on Vercel with PostgreSQL and Blob Storage integration.  
- **Comprehensive Error Handling** and fallback OCR providers for maximum reliability.
